## General info

The app is meant to be installed automatically by clicking on an e-mail invitation on your smartphone that contains a Firebase Dynamic Link, which automatically selects the proper app from the proper app store, installs it and activates the user's account using the account activation token in the Firebase Dynamic Link. The user is then asked to proceed by scanning, one-by-one, the QR-code that is attached to each Twomes measurement device that has been sent to the home address of the user. For each device scanned, the proper device installation instructions are retrieved from the Twomes server and presented. The app then connects with the device, which then scans for available wifi networks. The user is asked to select their home wifi network from the list of available networks and supply the password for that network. If everything has been entered correctly, the user is notified that the setup was completed successfully and can choose to configure the next device.

After adding one or more devices the collected measurement data can be viewed in various graphs. Giving the user the ability to view the collected data themselves. A list with all setup devices connected to the account is also available.

The app currently supports the following languages:

- English
- Dutch
