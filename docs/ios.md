# iOS development

When developing for iOS you need to have a Mac with Xcode and Ruby 3.1.0 installed. You can find more information about the setup [here](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/).

## Ruby
To install Cocoapods, Ruby is required. MacOS comes with a built-in version of Ruby that might not match the required version of this project. To install the correct version of Ruby, you can use `rbenv` using `homebrew`. If you don't have homebrew, you can learn more at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).

To install `rbenv` you can run the following command:
```bash
brew install rbenv
```
Then, install the correct version of Ruby (3.1.0) using `rbenv`:
```bash
rbenv install 3.1.0
```
After installing Ruby, you can set the global version of Ruby to 3.1.0:
```bash
rbenv global 3.1.0
```
You can verify that the correct version of Ruby is installed by running:
```bash
ruby -v
```
This should output something along the lines of `ruby 3.1.0p0 (2021-12-25 revision 123456) [x86_64-darwin20]`.

If this isn't the case, check where your Ruby version is coming from by running `which ruby`. If this is not the version you just installed, you can run `rbenv init` to get instructions on how to fix this.

If that doesn't work, try eval
```bash
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```
and then run `which ruby` again.

### Pods

After installing Ruby correctly, you can install the required pods by running the following command in the `ios` directory:
```bash
cd /apps/expo/ios

pod install
```

After getting the prerequisites installed you can start the development server with the following command:

```bash
yarn workspace app dev:ios
```

This will ask you to select a device or simulator to run the app on. It is recommended for developing that you connect your iPhone to your Mac and select that device because of the limitations of the simulator.

## Limitations

Although the iOS simulator is great for rapid development, it does come with a few limitations.

The following hardware is unavailable in Simulator:

- Audio Input
- Barometer
- Camera
- Motion Support (accelerometer and gyroscope)

This means that specificly testing the `NeedForHeat` app that the simulator isn't of any use because the camera is needed to detect the QR code.

## Issues

> The CLI seems to be stuck when opening a Simulator

Sometimes the iOS simulator doesn't respond to the open command. If it seems stuck on this prompt, you can open the iOS simulator manually `(open -a Simulator)` and then in the macOS toolbar, choose Hardware â†’ Device, and select an iOS version and device that you'd like to open.
